      <p>Rango and Mushu are the oldest and DiamondBack is a month or so younger! We adopted Mushu at the pet store, Rango from <b>Exotic Arc</b> and DiamondBack was an unexpected rescue from the Arc store! Me and my boyfriend take very great care of our bearded dragons. We love them very much and are super excited to share that with you!</p>
